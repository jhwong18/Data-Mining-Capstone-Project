# Data Mining Capstone Project
As part of the MH4510 Data Mining course in Nanyang Technological University, we have to embark on a data mining capstone project. For the capstone project we have selected the following topic: Modelling Music Recommendation for KKBOX.

# Abstract
The advent of technology has transformed how we consume music. As people increasingly prefer personalization in their consumption of music, radio channels and DJs have been replaced by online music stores and streaming services like iTunes (https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/), Spotify (https://www.spotify.com/), KKBox (https://www.kkbox.com/tw/tc/index.html) and Grooveshark (http://groovesharks.org/) [1]. However, there are many challenges in the algorithms for personal music recommendation service. Without enough historical data, how would an algorithm know if the user will like a new song or a new artist? How would the recommendation engine identify what songs to recommend new users? This project aims to predict whether a user will replay a song after listening to it for the first time, within a month, and therefore, recommend songs that users will enjoy the most. This can also be extended to new users by recommending songs to users of similar interests. The dataset is obtained from KKBOX, Asia’s leading music streaming service in Kaggle [2]. There are two main sources of data used for our prediction: song data and members information. The song data consists of song_id, song_length (in ms), genre_ids, artist_name, composer, language. The members information consists of msno, source_system_tab, source_screen_name, city, bd, gender.
